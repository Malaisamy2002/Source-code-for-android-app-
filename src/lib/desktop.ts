 * "browser vs native" fork in the app (backup.ts, github.ts, receipt.ts,
 * register-sw.ts) reads it from here instead of re-deriving it.
 *
 * Tauri v2 injects `window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__` into every webview at runtime
 * — that's the most reliable client-side signal (no build-time env var needed,
 * so a plain `vite build` output still runs correctly if it's ever loaded
 * inside a Tauri shell). We additionally check `window.__TAURI__` (present
 * when `app.withGlobalTauri` is enabled) as a fallback.

 * a second, chrome-less webview window rendering the remote site inside the
